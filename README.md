# CSYE 7245 - Big-Data Systems and Intelligence Analytics

### Course Description
Offers students an opportunity to learn a hands-on approach to understanding how large-scale data sets
are processed and how data science algorithms are adopted in the industry through case studies and
labs. This project-based course builds on INFO 7390 and focuses on enabling students with tools and
frameworks primarily to build end-to-end applications. The course is divided into three parts: building
the data pipeline for data science, implementing data science algorithms, and scaling and deploying data
science algorithms.

The ability to use python is part of the grade. Students must demonstrate ability to setup data for
learning, train, test, and evaluation using either python or R, but all assignment examples and solutions
will be presented in python. The assignments include paper exercises designed to reinforce conceptual
understanding. A term project is required.
